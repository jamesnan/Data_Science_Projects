    "In this project, we'll clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",

    "We want to know the following:\n",
    "1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",

    "We want to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both surveys used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. We'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and start to analyze the first question.\n",
