##  Predicting  Bike Rentals

### About:

In this project, we'll predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. We'll predict the 'cnt' column using all of the other columns, except for casual and registered. To accomplish this, we'll create a few different machine learning models including Linear Regression,Decision Trees Random Forests, and evaluate their performance.

We can download the data from the [University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
