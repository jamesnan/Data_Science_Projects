##  Creating a Kaggle Workflow

### About:

In this guided project, we created a reproducible workflow to help us iterate over ideas and continue to improve the accuracy of our predictions. We also created helper functions which will make feature selection, model selection/tuning and creating submissions much easier as we continue to explore the data and create new features.
