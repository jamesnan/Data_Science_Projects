## Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings 

### About:

In October 2015, Walt Hickey  published his [analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/), suggesting that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest.

In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. The data is publicly available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17
) and we'll use it to analyze the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis.

### Steps:

  * Understanding the Data
  * Changing the Goal of our Analysis
  * Isolating the Samples We Need
  * Comparing Distribution Shapes for 2015 and 2016
  * Comparing Relative Frequencies
  * Determining the Direction of the Change

### Built With :

  * Python 
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
