## Exploring Hacker News Posts

### About:

In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. You can find the data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts)
 
Our goal is to compare two types of posts to determine the following:
  * Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
  * Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

### Steps:
  
  * Removing Headers from a List of Lists
  * Extracting Ask HN and Show HN Posts
  * Calculating the Average Number of Comments for Ask HN and Show HN Posts
  * Finding the Amount of Ask Posts and Comments by Hour Created
  * Calculating the Average Number of Comments for Ask HN Posts by Hour
  * Sorting and Printing Values from a List of Lists

### Built With:

  * Python 
  * Jupyter Notebook
