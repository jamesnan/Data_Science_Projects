## Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

### About:

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

  * population — the global population.
  * population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
  * area — the total land and water area.

### Steps:

  1. Connect to database
  2. Overview of the Data
  3. Summary Statistics  of the world's largest and smallest country population and sizes/areas
  4. Exploring Outliers
  5. Exploring Average Population and Area
  6. Finding Densely Populated Countries
  7. Finding which country has the most people?
  8. Finding which country has the highest growth rate?
  9. Finding which countries have the highest ratio of water to land?
  10. Finding which countries have more water than land?
  11. Finding which countries will add the most people to their populations next year?
  12. Finding which countries have a higher death rate than birth rate?
  13. Finding which countries have the highest population/area ratio
